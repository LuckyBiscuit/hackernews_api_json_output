# hackernews_api_json_output
 
All you would need to run this file would be to the latest python version, all the modules and libraries that I used are internal python libraries / modules. Run the python file within the terminal with the integer value for the list of items that you would like returned.

The libraries and modules that I used for this project are: 
json
requests
pprint
sys

I used json to return the python dictionary response into a JSON string. 
I used requests to call the API from the hackernews api site. 
I used pprint module to turn the reponse into a more readable json response. 
I used sys to pass arguments for the integer into the response
